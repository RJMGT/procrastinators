## Sprint 3 Review

### Sprint Goal and Whether Achieved
Our goal for Sprint 3 was to deliver an end-to-end user journey that supports basic user-generated content. This included creating a post, updating the home feed in real time, enabling simple engagement actions such as like or dislike, and presenting user and post leaderboards.

✅ The sprint goal was achieved. All core functionality for a minimum viable product (MVP) was completed and deployed to the staging environment.
