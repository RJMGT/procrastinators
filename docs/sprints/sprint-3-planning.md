# Sprint Goal

Our goal for Sprint 3 was to deliver an end-to-end user journey that supports basic user-generated content. This includes creating a post, updating the home feed in real time, enabling simple engagement actions such as like or dislike, and presenting user and post leaderboards to highlight participation patterns.

# Planned Scope

We defined the following user stories and tasks for this sprint. Descriptions now include more generic functional and experiential details.

| # | Task | Description | Story Points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Create a post | As a user, I want to create and submit a Procrastination Story using a simple form that collects a title, a short description, and the hours I procrastinated. The system should validate required fields, confirm submission, and update shared views such as the Home Feed and Leaderboards. This allows me to contribute content and see it reflected across the platform. | 8 |
| 2 | Home Feed | As a user, I want to see the Home Feed immediately after logging in. The feed should display recent Procrastination Stories in a clear format, show basic metadata, and provide interaction buttons to like or unlike posts. This ensures that the platform feels active and that I can engage with others easily. | 5 |
| 3 | User Leaderboard | As a user, I want to see a leaderboard that ranks users based on their total logged procrastination hours. The leaderboard should present users consistently and refresh when new posts are created. This encourages friendly competition and helps me understand how I compare to others. | 5 |
| 4 | Post Leaderboard | As a user, I want to view a ranked list of posts that I can sort by likes, dislikes, or time. This helps me quickly find the most engaging or most recent stories and explore trends within the community. | 3 |

**Total Story Points Planned:** 21  
**Team Capacity:** 30 points (3 members × 10 points each)

We prioritized tasks that complete the main user journey and support a basic but functional interaction loop.
