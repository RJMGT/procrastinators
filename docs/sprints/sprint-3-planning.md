# Sprint Goal

Our goal for Sprint 3 was to deliver an end-to-end user journey: creating a post, updating the home feed, enabling like/dislike interactions, and displaying the corresponding leaderboards.

# Planned Scope

We defined the following user stories and tasks for this sprint:

| # | Task | Description | Story Points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Create a post | As a user, I want to submit my Procrastination Story (title, description, and procrastinated hours). After clicking **Create Post**, the Home Feed and Leaderboards should automatically update. | 8 |
| 2 | Home Feed | As a user, I want to see the Home Feed immediately after I log in. The feed should show the latest stories and allow like/unlike interactions. | 5 |
| 3 | User Leaderboard | As a user, I want to view the top users sorted by total procrastinated hours. | 5 |
| 4 | Post Leaderboard | As a user, I want to view all posts and sort them by likes, dislikes, or time. | 3 |

**Total Story Points Planned:** 21  
**Team Capacity:** 30 points (3 members × 10 points each)

We prioritized tasks that complete the core user journey.
