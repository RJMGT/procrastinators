Sprint Goal

Our goal for Sprint 2 was to build and deploy a working prototype that includes core onboarding and authentication functionality. The app needed to be deployed on a live environment and tested with at least one real user.

Planned Scope

We outlined the following user stories and tasks for this sprint:

#	Task	Description	Story Points
1	Authentication and user onboarding:	Set up Django's built-in authentication and onboarding flow	8
2	PostgreSQL setup:	Configure PostgreSQL on Render and connect via Django ORM	5
3	Live deployment:	Deploy app and database to Render	5
4	First user testing:	Test the full flow (login, data persistence) with at least one user 3

Total Story Points Planned: 26
Team Capacity: 30 points (3 members × 10 points each)

We prioritized tasks that were foundational to future development and would allow us to get early user feedback.
